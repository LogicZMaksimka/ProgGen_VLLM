1. Text Span: "Eater 38 list"
Label: (C). Wrong Type. The correct entity type is other.

2. Text Span: "kids menu"
Label: (A). Correct Entity Annotation.

3. Text Span: "brunch"
Label: (B). The span contains a named amenity entity but the span boundary is not precise. The correct span boundary is "brunch for delivery".

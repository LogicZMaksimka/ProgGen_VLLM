1. Text Span: "caf√©"
Label: (C). Wrong Type. The correct entity type is Cuisine.

2. Text Span: "diverse menu"
Label: (A). Correct Entity Annotation.

3. Text Span: "lunch"
Label: (B). The span contains a named amenity entity but the span boundary is not precise. The correct span boundary is "outdoor seating for lunch".

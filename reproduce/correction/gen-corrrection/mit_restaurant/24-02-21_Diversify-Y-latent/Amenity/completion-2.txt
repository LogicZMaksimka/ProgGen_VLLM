1. Text Span: "lunch"
   Label: (C). Wrong Type. The correct entity type is Hours.

2. Text Span: "not too expensive late night dining"
   Label: (A). The span is a named entity of type amenity

3. Text Span: "dinner tonight"
   Label: (B). The span contains a named amenity entity but the span boundary is not precise. The correct span boundary is "dinner".

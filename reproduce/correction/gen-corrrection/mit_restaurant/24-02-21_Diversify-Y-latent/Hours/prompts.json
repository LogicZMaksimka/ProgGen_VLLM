        "Here are 2 spoken queries to a dialogue system about restaurants. Your task is to classify whether the span of text is a named entity of type Hours.\nIn particular, for each query with a span of text enclosed in double braces, please classify the enclosed span of text in context of the query into one of the following categories:\n- (A). The span is a named entity of type hours\n- (B). The span contains a named hours entity but the span boundary is not precise\n- (C). The span is a named entity but the category is not hours\n- (D). The span is not a named entity\nIf the label is (B), you should provide the correct span boundary.\nIf the label is (C), you should provide the correct entity type. Pick an entity type from the following list:\n[Restaurant Name, Amenity, Cuisine, Dish, Location, Price, Rating, other].\n\nAny temporal reference to a specific time of day or day of the week is a named Hours entity. For example, \"10PM\", \"Friday\" and \"late-night\" are all named Hours entities.\nA named Hours entity must not contain irrelevant terms such as \"diner\" or \"reservation\".\nDays of the week such as \"Friday\" and \"Wednesday\" are named Hours entities. Meal times such as \"breakfast\", \"brunch\", \"lunch\" and \"dinner\" are also named Hours entities.\nGeneric hours descriptors such as \"hours-of-operation\", \"hours\", \"opening hours\" and \"operating hours\" are not named entities.\n\nHere are some example span classifications for your reference. Please follow this format.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Query: \"Call Olive Garden and make a {{reservation for 7:00 pm}}.\"\nText Span: \"reservation for 7:00 pm\"\nLabel: (B). Wrong Boundary.

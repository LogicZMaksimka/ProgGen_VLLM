A named rating entity is a specific rating score such as "5 star". Qualitative descriptions such as "good", "best", "high", "delicious" and "popular" are also named rating entities. Rating accolades such as "high-rated," "best ratings," and "best in town" are named rating entities. Awards such as "Michelin Star" are also named rating entities.
You should capture the complete descriptive phrase such as "best reviewed" as opposed to "best". You should always drop trailing "restaurant" and "place" words from named rating entities.

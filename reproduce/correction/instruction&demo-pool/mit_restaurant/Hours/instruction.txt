Any temporal reference to a specific time of day or day of the week is a named Hours entity. For example, "10PM", "Friday" and "late-night" are all named Hours entities.
Days of the week such as "Friday" and "Wednesday" are named Hours entities. Meal times such as "breakfast", "brunch", "lunch" and "dinner" are also named Hours entities.
A named Hours entity must not contain irrelevant terms such as "diner" or "reservation".
Generic hours descriptors such as "hours-of-operation", "hours", "opening hours" and "operating hours" are not named entities.

A named director entity must be the name of a film director. Only first names, last names, and full names of directors are considered named director entities.
You should always drop starting "new" and trailing "film" and "movie" words from named director entity spans.
Ambiguous identifiers such as "director", "female filmmaker" and "female directors" are not named entities.

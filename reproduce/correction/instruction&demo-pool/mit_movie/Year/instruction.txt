A named year entity must be a specific year or a year range indicating movie release, such as "2000" or "last three years".
You should always drop starting "the" word from named year entity spans.
Release qualifiers such as "released", "new release", "re-release" and "first" are also relevant named entities.
Vague temporal descriptors such as "latest", "recent", "recent movies" and "come out" are not named entities. Ambiguous identifiers such as "year" are also not named entities.

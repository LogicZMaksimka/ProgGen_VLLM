Only actual MPAA rating labels such as "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", and "NC-17" are named MPAA rating entities.
Rating interpretations such as "Parental Guidance Suggested" and "suitable for children" are not named MPAA rating entities.
You should always drop starting and trailing "rated" or "MPAA rating of" words from named MPAA rating entity spans.

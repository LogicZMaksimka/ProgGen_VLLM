Creating diverse spoken queries related to movies for a dialogue system or conversational agent involves considering a variety of attributes. Here are some key attributes to consider, along with examples in each category:

1. **Query Category**: Classify the type of information being sought.
   - Movie recommendations (e.g., "Recommend a comedy movie from the 90s.")
   - Specific movie information (e.g., "Who directed 'Inception'?")
   - Movie reviews and ratings (e.g., "What are the reviews for 'Parasite'?")
   - Movie showtimes and locations (e.g., "Where is 'Avatar' playing tonight?")

2. **Language and Dialect Variations**: Include different accents and dialects.
   - Standard American English (e.g., "Tell me about the latest Marvel movie.")
   - British English (e.g., "What are the top British movies of 2020?")
   - Indian English with an Indian accent (e.g., "List some Bollywood movies similar to 'Dil Chahta Hai'.")

3. **Demographic Variability**: Include queries from different age groups and genders.
   - Young audience (e.g., "What are some good animated movies for kids?")
   - Older audience (e.g., "Find classic movies from the 1960s.")
   - Gender-neutral queries (e.g., "Suggest some movies with strong female leads.")

4. **Genre Preferences**: Cover a wide range of movie genres.
   - Action (e.g., "List the latest action movies.")
   - Romance (e.g., "Can you recommend some romantic comedies?")
   - Documentary (e.g., "What are some critically acclaimed documentaries?")

5. **Cultural and Regional References**: Include culturally specific or regionally popular movies.
   - Hollywood (e.g., "What are the top-grossing Hollywood movies right now?")
   - Bollywood (e.g., "Which Bollywood movie won the best picture last year?")
   - East Asian cinema (e.g., "Recommend some popular Korean dramas.")

6. **Specificity and Complexity of Queries**: Vary the detail and complexity.
   - Simple (e.g., "Find movies starring Tom Hanks.")
   - Complex (e.g., "What are some movies that explore themes of existentialism?")

7. **Temporal Aspects**: Queries about past, present, and future movie-related events.
   - Current (e.g., "What movies are releasing this weekend?")
   - Historical (e.g., "What won the Best Picture Oscar in 1985?")
   - Future-oriented (e.g., "What are the most anticipated movies of next year?")

8. **Personalization and Preferences**: Tailor to individual tastes or specific requests.
   - Personal tastes (e.g., "I like thrillers, what should I watch?")
   - Specific requests (e.g., "Find movies similar to 'The Matrix' for me.")

These attributes, when combined in various ways, can help generate a rich and diverse set of spoken queries that can effectively test and train conversational agents in handling movie-related inquiries.

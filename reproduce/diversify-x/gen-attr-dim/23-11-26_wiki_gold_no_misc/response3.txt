Generating diverse sentences from Wikipedia articles involves considering various attributes. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Topic Variety**: Wikipedia covers a wide range of topics, from science to history, technology, art, and more. To ensure diversity, it's important to draw from a broad array of subjects.

2. **Writing Style**: Wikipedia articles are written in a formal, encyclopedic style. However, within this framework, there's a range of expression. Some articles are more technical, while others are narrative-driven. Sampling from different types of articles can enhance diversity.

3. **Depth of Information**: Articles vary in their complexity and depth. Some offer detailed, in-depth analyses, while others provide concise overviews. Including both types can add to the diversity of the sentences generated.

4. **Geographical and Cultural Representation**: Ensuring that the content covers a wide range of geographical locations and cultures can significantly enhance diversity. This includes articles about different countries, cultures, traditions, and historical events from around the world.

5. **Temporal Range**: Including historical as well as contemporary topics ensures a temporal diversity in the content. This could range from ancient history to modern technological advancements.

6. **Language and Translation**: Considering articles available in multiple languages can add to the diversity, especially in terms of cultural nuances and perspectives.

7. **Source Variety**: Wikipedia articles reference a range of sources, from academic journals to news articles and primary sources. Drawing from articles that use diverse sources can add another layer of diversity.

8. **Article Popularity and Obscurity**: Including both popular (frequently visited) and obscure (less known) articles can provide a balance of familiar and novel content.

9. **Visual and Textual Content**: While primarily text-based, Wikipedia also includes visual elements like images, charts, and tables. Incorporating sentences that describe or relate to these visual elements can add another dimension.

10. **User Contribution Patterns**: Wikipedia articles are edited by users worldwide, each bringing their own perspective. Considering articles with diverse editing histories can add to the sentence diversity.

By considering these attributes, one can generate a rich and varied set of sentences from Wikipedia, reflecting the vastness and diversity of the information it contains.

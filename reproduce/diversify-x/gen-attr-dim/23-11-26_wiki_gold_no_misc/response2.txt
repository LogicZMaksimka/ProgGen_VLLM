Generating diverse spoken queries related to movies for a spoken dialog system or conversational agent involves considering various attributes and factors. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of important attributes to achieve diversity in movie-related queries:

1. **Query Category:**
   - Genre: Queries can cover a wide range of movie genres such as action, romance, science fiction, horror, drama, etc.
   - Movie Information: Include queries about movie titles, release dates, directors, actors, and plot summaries.
   - Recommendations: Generate queries requesting movie recommendations based on specific preferences or moods.

2. **User Personality:**
   - Customize queries to match the user's personality. For example, a user with a preference for humor might ask queries related to comedy movies, while a user interested in history might inquire about historical films.

3. **Query Complexity:**
   - Vary the complexity of queries. Some users might ask straightforward questions like, "What's the latest Marvel movie?" while others might ask more complex questions such as, "Can you recommend a suspenseful movie with a plot twist?"

4. **Emotion and Mood:**
   - Generate queries that reflect different emotions and moods. Users may want to discuss movies that make them happy, sad, excited, or nostalgic.

5. **Temporal Attributes:**
   - Consider queries related to specific time periods, like classic movies from the 1950s, recent releases, or upcoming films.

6. **Query Format:**
   - Diversify query formats, including open-ended questions (e.g., "Tell me about your favorite movie") and specific requests (e.g., "Find me a list of Oscar-winning films").

7. **Movie-related Events:**
   - Incorporate queries related to movie-related events, such as film festivals, award shows, or movie premieres.

9. **Personal Preferences:**
   - Take into account individual preferences such as language (queries about foreign films), movie ratings (queries about highly-rated movies), or personal experiences (queries about favorite childhood movies).

10. **Interactivity:**
    - Encourage interactive queries that foster a conversation, such as hypothetical scenarios ("If you were a movie director, what kind of movie would you make?") or trivia questions.

11. **Trending Topics:**
    - Generate queries related to trending movies, actors, or controversies in the movie industry.

12. **User History:**
    - Consider the user's past interactions and queries to tailor new queries to their interests and preferences.

13. **Language Style:**
    - Vary the language style, including formal, informal, slang, or technical language, to cater to different user communication styles.

14. **Length and Detail:**
    - Provide both short and detailed queries. Some users may prefer quick answers, while others might appreciate in-depth discussions.

15. **Cross-genre Queries:**

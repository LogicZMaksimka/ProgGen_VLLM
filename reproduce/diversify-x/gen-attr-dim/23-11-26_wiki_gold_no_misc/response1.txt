Generating diverse spoken queries related to movies for a spoken dialog system or conversational agent requires careful consideration of various attributes. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of important attributes to ensure diversity in queries:

1. **User Persona**:
   - Different user personas can have distinct preferences and ways of phrasing queries related to movies. Consider generating queries that reflect various personas, such as film enthusiasts, casual viewers, critics, or parents looking for family-friendly options.

2. **Query Complexity**:
   - Vary the complexity of queries. Some users may ask straightforward questions like "What's the latest action movie?" while others might prefer complex and detailed queries like "Can you recommend a sci-fi movie released in the last year with a strong female lead?"

3. **Genre Diversity**:
   - Movies span various genres (e.g., action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, horror). Generate queries that cover a wide range of genres to cater to diverse user interests.

4. **Time Frames**:
   - Create queries that reference different time frames, such as recent releases, all-time classics, or specific decades (e.g., "Recommend a 90s romantic comedy" or "What are the top movies of 2023?").

5. **Cultural References**:
   - Consider queries that incorporate cultural references or events. For example, "Recommend a movie about space exploration for World Space Week."

6. **Emotion and Mood**:
   - Some users may want movie recommendations based on their current emotions or moods (e.g., "I'm feeling adventurous, suggest a movie"). Generate queries that capture various emotional states.

7. **Director/Actor Preferences**:
   - Users often have favorite directors or actors. Generate queries that ask for recommendations based on specific directors or actors (e.g., "Suggest a movie directed by Christopher Nolan" or "Find me a film starring Meryl Streep").

8. **Movie Trivia**:
   - Diversify queries by including trivia or obscure facts about movies (e.g., "Tell me a fun fact about the Star Wars franchise" or "What's the highest-grossing animated film of all time?").

9. **Comparative Queries**:
   - Encourage users to compare or contrast different movies (e.g., "What's better, The Godfather or Pulp Fiction?" or "Find me movies similar to Inception").

10. **User's Knowledge Level**:
    - Adjust query complexity based on the user's perceived knowledge level. Novice users may prefer simpler queries, while experts may appreciate more in-depth discussions.

11. **Current Events and Trends**:
    - Incorporate queries that relate to current events, film festivals, or emerging movie trends (e.g., "What movies won awards at Cannes this year?").

12. **Personalized Queries**:
    - Utilize user history and preferences to generate personalized movie queries. For example, "Based on my previous likes, recommend a movie I haven't seen yet."

13. **Open-Ended Queries**:
    - Occasionally generate open-ended queries that invite discussion or opinions (e.g., "What's your favorite movie of all time?" or "Tell me about a movie that made you cry").

14. **Ambiguity Handling**:
    - Be prepared to handle ambiguous queries and seek clarifications when necessary to provide relevant recommendations (e.g., "I'm in the mood for something different").

15. **Conversation Continuation**:
    - Ensure that queries can lead to meaningful follow-up questions or discussions to maintain an engaging conversation about movies.

By considering these attributes and generating queries that encompass a wide range of user preferences, interests, and conversation styles, a spoken dialog system or conversational agent can provide a more engaging and diverse movie-related conversation experience.

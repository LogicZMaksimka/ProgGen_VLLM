1. Carl Friedrich Gauss - A German mathematician who made significant contributions to many branches of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and statistics.

2. Ada Lovelace - An English mathematician often called the first computer programmer, known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.

3. Emmy Noether - A German mathematician known for her foundational contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics.

4. Grigori Perelman - A Russian mathematician who proved the Poincaré conjecture, one of the most famous problems in topology, and declined the Fields Medal and the Millennium Prize Award.

5. Sophie Germain - A French mathematician and physicist who made important contributions to number theory and elasticity theory, and who studied under and corresponded with many great mathematicians of her time.

6. David Hilbert - A German mathematician known for his work in many areas of mathematics, including foundations of geometry, integral equations, and invariant theory.

7. André Weil - A French mathematician known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry, and for his role in the establishment of the Bourbaki group.

8. Atiyah Singer index theorem - A landmark result in mathematics, which in general relates the analytical index of an elliptic operator to the topological index.
